0,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 68-year-old male presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain that began 3 hours ago while climbing stairs. The pain is substernal, crushing in quality, and radiates to his left arm. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 30-pack-year smoking history. Initial ECG shows ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6 and troponin I is mildly elevated at 0.15 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL). His blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg, heart rate is 92 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.","NSTEMI - initiate dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and prepare for cardiac catheterization","Point-of-care echocardiogram reveals apical ballooning with hyperkinetic basal segments and an ejection fraction of 35%, and the patient mentions his wife died unexpectedly in a car accident 2 days ago","This subsequent finding introduces complexity by presenting features highly suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress cardiomyopathy) which can mimic acute coronary syndrome. The apical ballooning pattern, recent severe emotional stressor, and modest troponin elevation relative to the degree of wall motion abnormality create a diagnostic dilemma. The clinician must now weigh whether to proceed with invasive coronary angiography versus conservative management, as Takotsubo typically shows normal or non-obstructive coronaries but can coexist with CAD in this demographic. This forces reconsideration of the initial NSTEMI diagnosis while maintaining vigilance for true ACS.",Opus 4.1,5,5,3,Claude Sonnet 4.5,5,5,2,Gemini 2.5 Pro
1,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 67-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset substernal chest pain radiating to her left arm. She is diaphoretic and nauseated. Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and well-controlled type 2 diabetes. On examination, her blood pressure is 98/64 mmHg, heart rate is 112 bpm, and she appears anxious and pale. The initial ECG shows ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads.",Acute inferior STEMI; prepare for urgent cardiac catheterization and initiate dual antiplatelet therapy,"On further questioning, the patient reveals she recently started taking sildenafil as prescribed by her urologist for pulmonary hypertension.","The subsequent finding of recent sildenafil use adds a critical reasoning challenge, as nitrates commonly used in STEMI management are contraindicated in patients who have recently taken phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors due to the risk of profound hypotension. This necessitates a change in standard treatment protocol and careful consideration of alternative therapies, making the reasoning task more complex and realistic for cardiovascular care.",GPT 4.1,5,5,4,K2 Thinking,4,4,3,o3
2,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 68-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe substernal chest pain that began 3 hours ago while climbing stairs. The pain radiates to his left arm and jaw. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a 40 pack-year smoking history. Initial ECG shows ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6 and troponin I is elevated at 0.8 ng/mL (normal <0.04). Blood pressure is 145/92 mmHg, heart rate is 98 bpm, and he appears diaphoretic.","NSTEMI - initiate dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and urgent cardiac catheterization",The patient mentions he has been experiencing intermittent fevers up to 38.5°C for the past 3 weeks and has lost 8 kg over the last 2 months without trying. Blood cultures drawn on admission are now growing gram-positive cocci in clusters.,"This subsequent finding introduces significant complexity because it raises the possibility of infective endocarditis with septic coronary embolization mimicking acute coronary syndrome. The presence of bacteremia, constitutional symptoms, and elevated troponin could represent either concurrent conditions (true NSTEMI with incidental bacteremia) or endocarditis causing coronary embolism or myocardial abscess. This forces the clinician to reconsider the urgency and approach to cardiac catheterization due to infection risks, evaluate for valvular vegetations with echocardiography, and balance anticoagulation risks with potential septic emboli. The management pathway diverges significantly between treating primary coronary disease versus infectious cardiac pathology.",Opus 4.1,5,5,2,GPT 4.1,0,0,0,GPT 5
3,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 72-year-old female with a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain radiating to her back. The pain began one hour ago while she was watching television and is described as severe, tearing, and unrelieved by nitroglycerin. On examination, her blood pressure is 180/98 mmHg in the right arm and 148/85 mmHg in the left arm. She is pale and diaphoretic, but her heart sounds are normal without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.",Acute aortic dissection; order CT angiography of the chest,"Review of systems reveals recent hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia with a 10-day course of oral corticosteroids, which ended 24 hours ago. On review of her labs, troponin I is mildly elevated, but ECG shows only nonspecific ST-T changes.","The addition of recent corticosteroid use raises the possibility of alternative diagnoses such as accelerated atherosclerosis, myocarditis, or stress cardiomyopathy, as immunosuppression can predispose to atypical presentations of cardiac disease. The mildly elevated troponin and nonspecific ECG changes complicate distinguishing between aortic dissection, acute coronary syndrome, and myocarditis, all of which require different initial management pathways. This scenario forces the clinician to weigh the risks and probabilities of multiple life-threatening cardiovascular and systemic conditions.",GPT 4.1,5,4,2,o3,0,0,0,GPT 5
4,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 72-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain radiating to her left arm, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. She has no known history of coronary artery disease, but describes having occasional exertional chest discomfort in recent weeks. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg, pulse is 92 bpm, and physical exam is unremarkable except for mild jugular venous distension. Her initial ECG reveals nonspecific ST-T changes, and troponin is pending.",Rule out acute coronary syndrome; initiate cardiac monitoring and obtain serial troponins.,A bedside echocardiogram reveals a moderate pericardial effusion with evidence of early right atrial collapse.,"The subsequent finding of a moderate pericardial effusion with early right atrial collapse significantly complicates the scenario. While the initial presentation was suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, the echocardiographic finding raises concerns for cardiac tamponade or another non-ischemic process. This forces the clinician to reconsider the working diagnosis and rapidly prioritize life-threatening causes of pericardial effusion such as malignancy, infection, or aortic dissection. The overlap of symptoms and findings requires complex reasoning, as the immediate management priorities now shift from ischemic evaluation to potentially urgent pericardiocentesis and further etiological investigation.",GPT 4.1,5,5,3,Claude Sonnet 4.5,5,5,4,K2 Thinking
5,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 67-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset retrosternal chest pain radiating to her left arm, associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is a current smoker with a 40-pack-year history. On examination, her blood pressure is 102/62 mmHg, heart rate is 108 bpm, and she appears anxious and clammy. Initial ECG demonstrates ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF.",Initiate STEMI protocol; order cardiac enzymes and arrange for emergent cardiac catheterization.,Bedside echocardiogram reveals a new holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border with associated signs of right ventricular overload.,"The subsequent finding introduces a new murmur and signs of right ventricular overload in a patient initially diagnosed with inferior STEMI. This could represent a new mechanical complication such as a ventricular septal rupture or acute papillary muscle rupture leading to severe acute mitral regurgitation. Both require urgent recognition and alter acute management significantly from typical STEMI treatment. The scenario challenges the clinician to interpret and integrate new physical findings, consider life-threatening complications, and adjust management accordingly. This adds complexity because common STEMI management (e.g., antithrombotics) could worsen outcomes if a mechanical complication is present.",GPT 4.1,5,4,3,o3,5,5,3,Claude Sonnet 4.5
6,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 67-year-old woman with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea over the past 6 months. Physical examination reveals elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral lower extremity edema, and a soft S3 gallop on cardiac auscultation. Electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia with left bundle branch block, and initial labs are notable for elevated B-type natriuretic peptide at 850 pg/mL.",Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction,Cardiac MRI reveals late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution pattern in the lateral left ventricular wall,"The subsequent finding was selected because it introduces competing diagnostic possibilities beyond ischemic cardiomyopathy. The subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement pattern is characteristic of non-ischemic cardiomyopathies such as cardiac sarcoidosis, myocarditis, or amyloidosis, forcing the clinician to reconsider the initial heart failure diagnosis. This creates complexity by requiring differentiation between ischemic and non-ischemic etologies, which have significantly different management strategies, prognostic implications, and treatment responses.",DeepSeek,4,5,2,o3,5,5,3,Gemini 2.5 Pro
7,cardiovascular,True,True,"A 68-year-old female presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea over the past 6 months.

Echocardiogram shows severe left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction of 60% and elevated filling pressures.",Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF),Laboratory results reveal serum albumin of 2.8 g/dL and proteinuria of 3.2 g/24 hours,"The subsequent finding of nephrotic syndrome introduces complexity by suggesting possible cardiac amyloidosis as an alternative diagnosis to hypertensive heart disease. This creates diagnostic uncertainty because the echocardiographic findings could represent either condition, requiring the clinician to reconsider whether the cardiac manifestations are primary or secondary to systemic disease. The reasoning task is complex as it necessitates differentiating between two distinct pathophysiological processes with similar presentations but different management strategies and prognoses.",DeepSeek,0,0,0,GPT 5,5,5,3,Claude Sonnet 4.5
