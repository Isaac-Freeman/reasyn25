The initial presentation is classic for an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), for which immediate reperfusion via PCI is life-saving. However, the significant blood pressure differential is a red flag for an acute aortic dissection, which can mimic a STEMI if the dissection flap occludes a coronary artery. The treatments are contradictory; giving anticoagulants and antiplatelets for a STEMI would be catastrophic in a patient with a dissection. This forces the clinician to rapidly reassess the primary diagnosis, weigh the risk of delaying reperfusion for the likely STEMI against the fatal risk of mismanaging a possible dissection, and decide on the next immediate diagnostic step (e.g., bedside echocardiogram, CTA of the chest) under extreme time pressure.'\n",
