      "  \"A 68-year-old male with a history of well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to the clinic with a two-week history of worsening shortness of breath on exertion. He denies typical anginal chest pain but describes a 'pressure' in his upper chest when walking up a flight of stairs, which resolves with rest. His initial ECG shows non-specific T-wave flattening in the lateral leads, and his initial high-sensitivity troponin from the emergency department yesterday was 12 ng/L (normal <14 ng/L).\"\n",

      "  'On a more detailed physical examination, a 3/6 late-peaking systolic ejection murmur is auscultated at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the carotid arteries.'\n",
      "  'This subsequent finding introduces a compelling alternative diagnosis—aortic stenosis—which perfectly mimics the symptoms of coronary artery disease in this patient demographic. The complexity arises from the significant overlap in symptoms and the high likelihood of co-existence of both conditions. The clinician must now weigh whether the symptoms are from flow-limiting coronary disease, a critical valve obstruction, or both. This changes the immediate diagnostic priority from coronary assessment (stress test/angiography) to a structural assessment (echocardiogram), as a stress test could be contraindicated if severe aortic stenosis is present.'\n",
